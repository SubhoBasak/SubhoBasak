                            national game and we had a great bonding. Here day by day I became a bad
                            student, my marks was getting worse year by year. We started cheating on
                            exam, calling sir/mam with nickname and most importantly started the
                            stupidy of relationship. But all the moment I spent, all the memories I
                            gain here is very special and very close to my heart. If I got a chance
                            I would definitely attend another class here with all my friends and
                            teachers.

                            admission in this college. That's the first time I went to far from home alone.
                            I got a new life here. Nobody was known to me. I got a chance to represent
                            myself as a new me. I made new friends, learned about different cultures, met
                            with different kinds of people. I discover a new me. I learned a lot, not only
                            engineering, but also about friendship, bonding, team work, communication. I
                            was very shy person in school, I didn't dance before. But in college at Arushi
                            (fresher's party) I dance for the first time. Because everybody was unknown to
                            me, that's why I didn't care about what they will think about me. First time
                            I did my stage performence in college, I play a role of superman in drama. And
                            it's my new family.
